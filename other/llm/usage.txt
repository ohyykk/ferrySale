Cleaned Data


write r code to do some ploting about this csv data
Make sure that when you do a lineplot of redemption and sales count over time, try to make both categories visible or the sales count will cover most of redemption count. Consider make two parallel graphs for the redemption and sales counts over time line graph.
For the scatterplot of the relationship between redemption and sales count, try to make the graph look good instead of most points accumulating at the botom left corner.
For the boxplot of sales and redemption, make sure it is easier to compare the two.

melted_data <- data %>%
  select(Timestamp, Sales.Count, Redemption.Count) %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = c(Sales.Count, Redemption.Count), 
               names_to = "Category", values_to = "Count")

# Boxplot to compare Sales Count and Redemption Count
ggplot(melted_data, aes(x=Category, y=Count, fill=Category)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(title="Boxplot: Sales Count vs Redemption Count", y="Count") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.position = "none")

您说：
for the first plot, how do I make them to be parrallel on the same graph but both to be visible? maybe you can have the y axis to be 0-6000 both on the positive and the negative axis and put one of redemption and sales on top and the other on the bottom backwards

To create a single plot with parallel line plots where one y-axis is inverted, we can use a secondary y-axis with opposite directions in R. Here’s how to create such a plot using ggplot2 with the sec.axis function to display the Redemption.Count on the positive y-axis and Sales.Count on the negative y-axis.

R
复制代码
# Load necessary libraries
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)

# Load data
data <- read.csv("cleaned_data.csv")

# Convert the Timestamp to a datetime object for proper plotting
data$Timestamp <- as.POSIXct(data$Timestamp, format="%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ")

# Sort data by Timestamp for plotting time series
data <- data %>% arrange(Timestamp)

# Calculate the range for both y-axes to have a symmetrical appearance
y_max <- max(max(data$Sales.Count), max(data$Redemption.Count))

# Create the plot
ggplot(data, aes(x = Timestamp)) +
  # Line plot for Redemption Count
  geom_line(aes(y = Redemption.Count), color = "blue", size = 1) +
  # Line plot for Sales Count inverted
  geom_line(aes(y = -Sales.Count), color = "green", size = 1) +
  # Set y-axis limits symmetrically
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(-y_max, y_max),
                     breaks = seq(-y_max, y_max, by = 1000),
                     sec.axis = sec_axis(~ -., 
                                         name = "Sales Count",
                                         breaks = seq(y_max, -y_max, by = -1000))) +
  labs(title = "Redemption and Sales Count Over Time",
       y = "Redemption Count",
       x = "Timestamp") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.title.y.right = element_text(color = "green"),
        axis.title.y.left = element_text(color = "blue"))
Explanation:
geom_line(aes(y = Redemption.Count), color = "blue", size = 1): Plots the Redemption.Count normally on the y-axis.
geom_line(aes(y = -Sales.Count), color = "green", size = 1): Inverts the Sales.Count values by multiplying them by -1, so they appear below the x-axis.
scale_y_continuous(...): Sets the y-axis range from -y_max to y_max and creates a secondary axis (sec.axis) with the inverse transformation ~ -. for Sales.Count.
theme(...): Adjusts the theme to differentiate the axis titles for clarity.
This setup will provide a single graph with both counts visible and symmetrical around the x-axis, effectively displaying Sales.Count inverted below the axis.

您说：
can you keep the graph this way but make the negative numbers in the y axis disappear

5/5

ChatGPT 说：
ChatGPT
To keep the graph the same way while making the negative numbers disappear from the y-axis, we can customize the y-axis labels to only display the positive numbers. This way, the graph's appearance remains the same, but the axis labels will be clearer and more intuitive.

Here's how you can modify the code to achieve this:

R
复制代码
# Assuming data is already loaded and sorted

# Calculate the range for both y-axes to have a symmetrical appearance
y_max <- max(max(data$Sales.Count), max(data$Redemption.Count))

# Create the plot
ggplot(data, aes(x = Timestamp)) +
  # Line plot for Redemption Count
  geom_line(aes(y = Redemption.Count), color = "blue", size = 1) +
  # Line plot for Sales Count inverted (to keep the appearance)
  geom_line(aes(y = -Sales.Count), color = "green", size = 1) +
  # Set y-axis limits symmetrically and customize the labels
  scale_y_continuous(
    limits = c(-y_max, y_max),
    breaks = seq(-y_max, y_max, by = 1000),
    labels = function(x) ifelse(x < 0, "", x),  # Remove labels for negative numbers
    sec.axis = sec_axis(~ abs(.),  # Use abs(.) to remove negative signs
                        name = "Sales Count",
                        breaks = seq(0, y_max, by = 1000))
  ) +
  labs(title = "Redemption and Sales Count Over Time",
       y = "Redemption Count",
       x = "Timestamp") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(
    axis.title.y.right = element_text(color = "green"),
    axis.title.y.left = element_text(color = "blue"),
    axis.text.y.left = element_text(color = "blue"),  # Color y-axis labels for clarity
    axis.text.y.right = element_text(color = "green")  # Color secondary y-axis labels
  )
Explanation:
labels = function(x) ifelse(x < 0, "", x): This removes the labels for negative values on the primary y-axis by replacing them with an empty string "".
sec.axis = sec_axis(~ abs(.), ...): Ensures the secondary y-axis shows positive labels for the Sales.Count.
theme(...) Customization: Colors the y-axis labels to distinguish between the Redemption and Sales counts.
This modification will remove the negative numbers from the y-axis, making the graph more visually intuitive while keeping the style you like.






您说：
can you choose some timestamps from the cleaned data and create a table that illustrate some examples of cleaned data using r code

6/6

ChatGPT 说：
ChatGPT
It seems that I need to redefine the dataset in R, as the previous data was handled in Python. Let's create an R code snippet to select and display some example rows from the cleaned data.

R Code to Create a Sample Table
R
复制代码
# Load necessary libraries
library(dplyr)

# Load data
data <- read.csv("cleaned_data.csv")

# Convert the Timestamp to a datetime object for proper formatting
data$Timestamp <- as.POSIXct(data$Timestamp, format="%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ")

# Select a few sample timestamps for illustration
sample_data <- data %>% sample_n(5, set.seed(42))  # Randomly select 5 rows with seed for reproducibility

# Display the sample data
print(sample_data)
Explanation:
data <- read.csv("cleaned_data.csv"): Load the cleaned data from the CSV file.
data$Timestamp <- as.POSIXct(data$Timestamp, format="%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ"): Convert the Timestamp column to a datetime object for clarity.
sample_data <- data %>% sample_n(5, set.seed(42)): Randomly select 5 rows from the data for illustration. The set.seed(42) ensures reproducibility.
print(sample_data): Display the selected sample data.
You can adjust the sample_n value to include more or fewer rows as needed. ​​

Yes, the table code you've provided works well for creating a sample of the cleaned ferry ticket counts data using the knitr::kable() function. Here's a breakdown of how your code works and a few tips to ensure it runs smoothly:

Breakdown of the Code:
Suppressing Startup Messages: This prevents unnecessary messages from loading the packages, keeping the output clean.

R
复制代码
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(knitr))
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(readr))
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(dplyr))
Loading the Data: The CSV file is loaded into the data dataframe. The show_col_types = FALSE suppresses the message about column types.

R
复制代码
data <- read_csv("C:/Users/yuqiu/ferrySale/ferrySale-main/outputs/data/cleaned_data.csv", show_col_types = FALSE)
Selecting a Segment: Rows 51 to 60 are selected from the data to create a sample segment.

R
复制代码
segment_data <- data[51:60, ]
Modifying for Display:

ID: Creates a new ID column starting from 51.
Time: Extracts time from the Timestamp.
Date: Extracts date from the Timestamp.
R
复制代码
segment_data <- segment_data %>%
  mutate(ID = row_number() + 50,                          
         Time = format(as.POSIXct(Timestamp), "%H:%M:%S"), 
         Date = format(as.POSIXct(Timestamp), "%Y-%m-%d"))
Selecting Columns for Display: Only the relevant columns are selected for the table.

R
复制代码
table_data <- segment_data[, c("ID", "Time", "Redemption.Count", "Sales.Count", "Date")]
Creating the Table: The kable() function is used to create a neatly formatted table with custom column names and alignment.

R
复制代码
kable(table_data, col.names = c('ID', 'Time', 'Tickets Redeemed', 'Tickets Sold', 'Date'), 
      align = "c", 
      caption = "Sample of cleaned Ferry Ticket Counts Data")
Tips:
Check File Path: Ensure the file path is correct and accessible.
Install knitr Package: Make sure the knitr package is installed if you plan to use kable().
If the table appears as expected, then your code is functioning correctly! If you have any additional requirements or questions, feel free to ask.
