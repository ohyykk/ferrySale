# Toronto Island Ferry Ticket Sales Analysis
## Overview
The Toronto Island Ferry is a popular mode of transportation, with varying levels of ticket sales and redemptions throughout the year. This [paper](https://github.com/ohyykk/ferrySale/blob/main/paper/paper.pdf) utilizes the 2024 installment of the "Toronto Island Ferry Ticket Counts" dataset from [OpenDataToronto](https://open.toronto.ca/dataset/toronto-island-ferry-ticket-counts/). 

By analyzing these patterns, the study offers insights into ferry usage trends across different days and times, drawing connections between historical developments and current usage patterns. Integrating both historical and modern perspectives, this analysis provides detailed quantitative recommendations for predicting ferry ticket usage and highlights key operational considerations.
